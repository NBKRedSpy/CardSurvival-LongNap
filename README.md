# Long Nap
![Alt text](media/NapUi-small.png)  
Adds a new option called "Long Nap" which is a six hour nap.

It has the same benefits as if the character was able to take 1.5 naps.

## Chinese
DeepL.com translated

增加了一个新的选项，叫做 "长时间小睡"，这是一个六小时的小睡。

它的好处与人物能够进行1.5次小睡的好处相同。


# Languages
The game will automatically pick up the player's language.

Translations can be changed in the localization files located in the ./lang folder.

|Language|File Name|
|--|--|
|English|./lang/en.csv|
|Chinese|./lang/zh.csv|

## Additional Languages
If there is a new language added to the game, the mod will attempted to load translations from a file named ```./lang/{Game's Langauge Name}.csv```.
Translations can be added to that file.

A warning will be added to the ```.\BepInEx\LogOutput.log``` indicating the fallback translation file name.
